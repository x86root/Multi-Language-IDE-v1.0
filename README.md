# Multi-Language-IDE-v1.0
A Python/PyQt5 based IDE for programmers and developers offering one platform for compiling and running different languages. As a dev, a tedious task can be having to switch IDE's for different languages. While VS Code offers a similar solution,  it is a very heavy program with  unneccesary files. My goal is to make an IDE that is minimal &amp; simple.
